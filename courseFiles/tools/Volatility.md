**Volatility** is the world's most widely used framework for extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer visibility into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended to introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into this exciting area of research

Volatility 3 is a complete rewrite of the original framework released in 2019, built to address performance, architecture, and modularity limitations of Volatility 2. It features an improved license (Volatility Software License), clean design, and better extensibility

## Setup

All you need is to clone it's repo and cd in
```bash
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git 
```
```bash
cd volatility3
```

To run it do
```bash
python3 vol.py
```

## General Usage

To list needed plugins and get help you can use

- For **Windows**
```bash
python3 vol.py -h | grep windows
```

- For **Linux**
```bash
python3 vol.py -h | grep linux
```

- For general help
```bash
python3 vol.py -h
```

- For specific commands ( change ``windows.pslist.PsList`` with whatever command you wish )
```bash
python3 vol.py windows.pslist.PsList -h
```

## Windows Usage
**Usefull commands**

- Lists processes seen in the OSâ€™s active process list (name, PID, PPID, times, etc.)
```bash
python3 vol.py -f /path/to/memdump windows.pslist.PsList
```

- Shows processes in a parent/child tree to visualize lineage
```bash
python3 vol.py -f /path/to/memdump windows.pstree.PsTree
```

- Signature-scans memory to find process objects (including hidden/unlinked/terminated ones)
```bash
python3 vol.py -f /path/to/memdump windows.psscan.PsScan
```
