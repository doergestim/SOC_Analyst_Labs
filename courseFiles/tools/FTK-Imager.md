### Overview
FTK Imager is a free forensic tool from AccessData used to preview and capture data in a forensically sound manner. In SOC and IR work, it’s mainly used to acquire disk images, capture volatile memory, and quickly review files without altering the source system

### Core Features
- **Disk Imaging** – Create exact, bit-level copies of entire drives, partitions, or removable media
- **File System Preview** – Browse directories and files before imaging
- **Memory Acquisition** – Capture live RAM, including pagefile.sys if needed
- **Hashing** – Generate MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 values to confirm evidence integrity
- **Export Options** – Save in multiple formats: E01, RAW/DD, AFF, SMART
- **Evidence Mounting** – Mount acquired images in read-only mode for safe examination

### Common Use Cases in a SOC
- Creating forensic images from compromised machines
- Capturing volatile memory during incident response
- Extracting email containers (PST/OST) for investigation
- Quick triage: checking file systems, logs, or suspicious files
- Preserving evidence in a defensible format for later deep analysis
