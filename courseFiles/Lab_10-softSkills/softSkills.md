# Soft Skills
Soft skills are what will make you stand out as a SOC analyst, even while technical skills are what got you in. Developing the mentality, communication patterns, and teamwork that increase your efficacy in a real-world Security Operations Center is the main goal of this session. Asking more intelligent questions, outlining your research in detail, recording your findings, and making a significant contribution to your team are all skills you will acquire. You'll not only develop more quickly, but you'll also aid in the growth of those around you by forming the habits of curiosity, clarity, and constant learning.

## Ask Questions
### Why does it matter
SOC work is a mess, you may encounter log entries, notifications, or tools that you don't entirely understand

What distinguishes true analysts from button-pushers is curiosity.

### How to practice
When reviewing logs, pause and ask yourself
- What is this log source?
- What process generated this?
- Is this normal for this user/system?

Dig deeper instead of just closing an alert, ask why it happened, not just what happened

### For Example
You see this log line from an EDR:
<pre>powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -encodedCommand JABX...</pre>
Bad analysts ignore it. Curious analysts:
