## Introduction

Malware forensics is the process of dissecting malicious binaries to understand their behavior, purpose, and potential impact on a system or network
As a SOC Analyst, your goal isn’t always to reverse-engineer malware from scratch — but to understand what it does, how it got in, what it affected, and how to respond

Malware forensics bridges the gap between incident response and reverse engineering. This chapter focuses on how to perform malware triage, dynamic and static analysis, and collect actionable intelligence

## The Malware Analysis Workflow

1. **Collection** – Obtain the binary safely ( from sandbox, EDR quarantine, memory dump, etc. )
2. **Preparation** – Set up an isolated analysis environment (VM or sandbox)
3. **Static Analysis** – Examine the binary without running it
4. **Dynamic Analysis** – Execute it in a controlled environment to observe real behavior
5. **Behavioral Forensics** – Trace what files, registry keys, and network indicators it creates
6. **Reporting & IOC Extraction** – Summarize findings into indicators for detection or hunting


## Safe Analysis Environment

Never analyze malware on your host OS. Always use:

- Isolated Virtual Machines ( VMware, VirtualBox, or KVM )
- Snapshots for quick rollback
- No shared clipboard or folders
- Disabled network adapter ( or use a simulated internet setup )


### Recommended Tools
- **Remnux** (Linux-based reverse engineering distro)
- **Flare VM** (Windows reverse engineering suite)
- **Cuckoo Sandbox** or **Any.Run** for automated analysis
- **Wireshark**, **Procmon**, **Regshot**, **Autoruns**, **PEStudio**, **x64dbg**
