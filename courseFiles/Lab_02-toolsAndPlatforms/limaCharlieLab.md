## Let's set up the lab
- Firstly, id you didn't go through our documentation, go through it now [Lima Charlie](/courseFiles/tools/LimaCharlie.md)

We will be using a fake attack from Atomic Red and learn how to use Lima Charlie to go through and understand the logs, FYI I am using the new theme of LC in case it looks different from yours

- Let's get the add-on from Atomic Red, go to **Add-Ons** on the top right

<br><br>

- Search for `ext-atomic-red-team` and click on it, then subscribe

<br><br>

- Now going back to your organization, head over to the **Extensions** tab on the left and then select **atomic red-team**
