### Please go though the documenation and setup for the [Cloud Version](/courseFiles/tools/Elastic_Doc_Cloud.md)

## GOAL
- Set up and use Elastic SIEM on your system
- Learn how to ingest logs and visualize them
- Learn how to use SIEM (Hosts, Users, Alerts)
- Learn how to create basic detection rules

1. Head over to **Discover** and see your logs flowing from the agent

- On the left side you can see, add, or remove data fields and data views ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

- On the middle and right side you will see the logs flowing in, you can explore them and try to make out where each one came from, you can also search and sort them ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

<img width="1568" height="710" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbfba1e-6cc4-4faf-a11c-8c6714411c05" />

- On the upper side you can see the traffic density on a specific timeling and a way to filter your logs, say you want to only see the logs coming from syslog, you would want to filter like this `event.dataset: "system.syslog"` since we are using filebeat, it's really easy and intuitive to make whatever filters you want ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

<br><br>

2. Now go to Security -> Explore, here we can see

- **Hosts** - Check user logins, uptime, etc.
- **Users** - Auth activity
- **Network** - IP traffic

<img width="1290" height="892" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ca936bd-6e06-46d7-921c-889d3b75e6d1" />

For now head over to **Hosts** 

On the lower side you can see details and logs related to Hosts, explore them and try to distinguish one action from another

<img width="1670" height="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79cac696-8935-4f50-b3ed-68f62ba83869" />

<br><br>

3. Create a Basic Detection Rule
- Click on Security -> Rules -> Detection Rules
<img width="1918" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0907037-a1a1-49fc-a06b-74057038b98a" />

- Create new rule -> **Select** Custom Query
- Index patterns: `default ones` + `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`
- Custom query: `event.code: 1 and host.os.type: "windows"` - Continue
- Name: `Creation Rule`
- Description: `My first rule`
- Default Severity: `Medium`
- Default risk score: `30` - Continue
- Runs every: `1 Minutes` - Continue -> Create & enable rule
<br><br>

Now if you go over to alerts you can see your Rule's work! If you don't see anything try creating different processes like notepad, cmd, etc and give it a minute

<img width="1670" height="904" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1e3c119-2668-482d-9ca4-0e1ea9cebab3" />
<br><br>

4. Let's now try to **Investigate Alerts with Timelines**
- Go to Security -> Alerts if you weren't here already
- Click an alert from your detection rule
- Click ‚ÄúInvestigate in timeline‚Äù (second button)
 <img width="158" height="32" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e9cb2c4-9505-495b-961b-71158b101e5f" />

### You can:
- See logs from before and after the alert
- Use the filter bar to expand your view (e.g. user.name:root)
- Drag in fields like event.dataset, message, host.name
- Click the üíæ Save icon to save it

<br><br>

## Try to add more rules by yourself or even simulate attacks to better understand the perspectives of both an attacker and a SOC analyst
