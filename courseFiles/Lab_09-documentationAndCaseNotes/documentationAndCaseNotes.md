# Documentation & Case Notes
Why does it matter
- **Auditability** – Incident records must be reproducible for compliance (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2)
- **Operational Continuity** – Night shift picks up where day shift left off
- **Evidence Trail** – Case notes may be used in legal proceedings or HR actions
- **Knowledge Base** – Patterns emerge from well-documented incidents, improving detection

Documentation types
| Type  | Purpose | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Case Notes  | Running log of your findings/actions  | Notes in your SOAR tool |
| Incident Timeline  | 	Chronological record  | Used in after-action reports |
| Alert Triage Summary | Final write-up after triage | SOC ticket or escalation |
| Investigation Report | Full postmortem | Often created by Tier 2+ |

Bad Documentation Causes
- Missed hand-offs
- Incorrect escalation
- Slower containment
- Incomplete RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
