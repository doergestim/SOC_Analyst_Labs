## The objective of this lab is to use Hayabusa to analyze Sysmon logs and detect suspicious activity related to process creation, network connections, and authentication events.

To start off we need to make sure we have the detection rules of hayabusa:

$ `hayabusa update-rules`

**If you don't have hayabusa installed follow the tutorial from the [Hayabusa Documentation](/courseFiles/tools/hayabusa.md)**
